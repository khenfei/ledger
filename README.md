#Ledger
A simple web application to keep track daily expense. 

What inspires the creation of this project:
1. I have a habit to keep track of my own expense by keeping all the receipts. This habit causes my drawer full of receipts. An improvement is needed to get rid of this issue.
2. I started delving into Ruby Language not too long ago. I want to explore some common (GEM) libraries used in building a standard Ruby on rails web application.

## Basic feature

1. Authentication
    - Database Login
    - Google Plus 0Auth
2. Authorization
    - Access control
3. Expense item CRUD operation.
4. Visual report generation.

## Future backlog
5.  OCR data input support.
